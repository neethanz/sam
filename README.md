- **Context-based** state management
- **Persistent sessions** using localStorage
- **Protected routes** with automatic redirects
- **Loading states** during authentication checks

### Navigation Bar
- Welcome message with username
- Logout functionality
- Responsive design
- Sticky positioning

### Interactive Counter
- Demonstrates React state management
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Responsive button design

### Todo List

## 🎯 Customization

### Colors & Themes
The app uses CSS custom properties for easy theming. Main colors are defined in gradients:
- Primary: `#667eea` to `#764ba2`
- Accent: `#61dafb` to `#21d4fd`
- Success: `#28a745`
- Danger: `#dc3545`

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new page components in `src/pages/`
2. Add corresponding CSS files
3. Update routing in `App.jsx`
4. Add to navigation if needed

### Authentication Configuration
Edit `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` to:
- Change dummy credentials
- Add real API endpoints
- Modify session management
- Add user roles/permissions

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints at:
- Desktop: `>768px`
- Mobile: `≤768px`

All pages adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

## 🔧 Development Tips

- **Hot Reload**: Changes are reflected instantly during development
- **Component Structure**: Each page has its own CSS file for modularity
- **State Management**: Uses React Context for global auth state
- **Route Protection**: Automatic redirects based on authentication status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and loading indicators

## 🚀 Deployment
